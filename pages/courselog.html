            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Class 1: Web Dev 101</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">I wasn't able to make the first lecture due to my flight, but Alex was very kind in re-recording the lecture. I found the lecture and tutorial very easy to follow along, although I had some trouble with installing git on my computer (GitHub and Visual Code Studio work, but Git doesn't work inside VCS?). I was pleasantly surprised that despite my limited experience coding, I was able to make a "website" after only the first class! I'm particularly interested in learning how to create interactive user journeys, learning how to best include 3D interactives, and scrollytellys (in that order).</div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Class 2: Web Dev 102</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">I was really amazed by how easy things were - even though it’s a basic website, ti’s very exciting to be able to put it together all on our own! I found the different syntax between HTML and CSS to be hard - hopefully it will come with time...</div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Class 3: Storyboarding & Preproduction</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">My main takeaways from this lecture were: 
                low fidelity gets the job done!
                Plan ahead - an hour spent up front is worth ten later down the line
                Storyboards, when used effectively, can convey many things such as action, atmospheric effect, colour blocking, and characterizations, which is helpful when in the planning stage with a client.</div>
            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Class 4: Previzualization for nonlinear media</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">My main takeaways from this lecture were: 
                There's a lot of ways to cook an egg - storyboards can be very different but still effective in their execution
                Colour coding actions and transitions with redudancy codes into the description text is helpful for storyboards!
                Be mindful of where your energy is best directed (ex, lower dfidelity but more complex descriptions of actions/transitions... or opposite depending on the scene).
