            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, we pitched our project and had some brainstorming sessions as a group, and I rounded it off with research on our topic.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                Project pitches: Each interactive group pitched their project and gave a breakdown of their project vision, assigned roles, and timeline. Min, Nic and I pitched our concept of “Trauma in Time,” as we want to explore the physical changes that occur in children of trauma survivors. Designed for an educated audience familiar with trauma, our inspiration is that mental illnesses such as PTSD can be confusing for people with diagnoses as well as their loved ones to navigate, and since the journey to healing is not always a steady climb, it’s important to have empathy and patience as people try different treatments and coping strategies. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                In recent years, we’ve heard of excitement into the biological mechanisms of PTSD (and its treatment with psychedelics), so we thought that visualizing this research could be a good opportunity to highlight engaging findings, as well as build some empathy, that changes from PTSD are not all just “in your head:” there are real, physical changes that occur in the body. The concept of epigenetic inheritance of trauma is very compelling too, and I really empathize with children of trauma survivors – it must be hard to be so affected, and confusing if you didn’t directly experience the trauma yourself.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                When our group sat down to brainstorm, we explored a couple possibilities for the narrative – we could follow some case studies (ex. the Holocaust, pregnant mothers that were at the World Trade Centre, survivors and children from the Dutch Famine), or explore trauma as more of a vague event that affects our main character. We were especially inspired by Here, a comic by Richard McGuire, in how it showed events in one space across time.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                Some difficulties – it felt difficult to narrow down the topic. We were also worried about the ability to make clear statements, in case the literature was conflicting. Our topic needed a lot of research up front before we could clarify our concept. This upcoming week, I will be doing more research…
                
            </div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Week 2: Feb 5-11</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, I did the main research for our project, and our team met for more concepts to bounce around. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
I used Web of Science to conduct a literature review into the epigenetic inheritance of trauma. One author (Yehuda) had done a lot of research on this particular topic, which was especially helpful. I gathered some papers from my initial review and read some major review papers and relevant latest studies to help set me in the right direction. I used Zotero to organize the papers and also share them (plus my annotations) with the team.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
I found a wealth of research on the Holocaust, but reassuringly, I found that the current research corroborated findings between studies and had less conflicting theories than I was expecting. One issue I realized we needed to discuss as a team was that there are two competing theories intergenerational trauma inheritance – that trauma is passed down through developmentally programmed effects (ex. Maternal effects during pregnancy), or through epigenetic inheritance like we had decided to focus on. Some of the case studies we were interested in (ex WTC pregnant mothers) were focusing on the former theory, so after discussion as a team we opted to rule out those case studies.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Another big takeaway was that while the specific genes modified from trauma as well as causal links between epigenetic modification and impacts on children of trauma survivors were contested, the current research seemed to be fairly consistent in the results. Specifically, trauma survivor offspring had increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity and lower cortisol levels than normal. Low cortisol was also linked to a higher chance of developing PTSD. Since cortisol and GRs fit into the overall stress response, I was relieved that the molecular side of our project may have fewer players than I originally expected!
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
I compiled my findings in Google Docs, and then wrote a more clear summary for my groupmates to review before meeting. I also did some ideation on potential user flow for our module. Having the research more clarified helped us narrow in on our narrative (lead by Min) and our approach of one central story vs multiple “modules.” Because the case studies in the literature were fairly consistent, we also decided to move forward with a vague metaphor for trauma, rather than focusing on a specific study as to not overgeneralize our findings. We also discussed level of detail and what would be relevant for our target audience.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Our topic is quite complex, so it’s understandable that the research stage is taking a long time, but I hope this won’t drag out our production process too much!

            </div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Week 3: Feb 12-18</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, we met as a team to create the preproduction draft. After, I wrote the script and made thumbnails for the project. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                We decided to populate the preproduction draft together by brainstorming as a team. It was a helpful exercise to write down our specific goals and technical requirements- probably something we should have done earlier, but we wanted to allow flexibility as we ideated. At this point, we committed to our concept of a single story following a family, where the parents have experienced trauma and the child struggles with stressful situations. The setting will be centred on the bedroom (we went back and forth on living spaces).
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                I created the thumbnails and wrote the script over the weekend. My main goal was to bring down the reading level as much as possible, and include the minimal amount of information needed for a reader to understand and grasp our main points. Using the research summary from last week and the rough thumbnails we had reviewed as a group in our last meeting, I created slightly higher fidelity thumbnails, and then created a script that followed the thumbnails and matched the research.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                I ended up going veryyyy low fidelity with the thumbnails, since as a team we agreed that Min would be in charge of storyboarding for the project, so I only drew enough for Nic and Min to understand what each object/character was. I drew and compiled the thumbnails in Figma, using Min’s concept art of the bedroom as a backdrop. To keep the reading level low, I wrote the script slowly, using words with three or less syllables, a small vocabulary, and short sentences. I used Chat-GPT as an editor, asking it to rewrite passages at a sixth or fifth-grade reading level, and then adjusting its edits.
                
            </div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Week 4: Feb 19-25</div>

            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, I mostly reviewed my team’s work as we narrowed down the script, and I created the content inventory.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
Min did a lot of extra research on top of storyboarding, and pointed out some vague and inconsistent parts of my script, which was really helpful. In some areas, Min was concerned that I oversimplified things, and added back in some detail. They also noticed one part seemed inconsistent (on the ending of the stress response) and clarified that part too. It was interesting to see how in simplifying, I had lost important details, but I couldn’t tell because I still had the context of the research I had done – I was no longer able to approach the script as a clean slate, and I interpreted the script with my existing knowledge in a way that made sense to me. This highlighted the importance of having many eyes on a script, to avoid misinterpretations or assumptions.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Reviewing Min’s storyboard was straightforward since it was in a shared FigJam board, which was helpful. As a team, we reviewed the storyboard and script, and Min planned to make the next iteration. I was able to pull up some style guide resources from Shay as well as Naomi Wee to help Nic compile a style guide for the scrollytelly.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Over the weekend, I created a content inventory for our project, using the storyboard, script, and Nic’s new style guide as references for the components and interactions we would need for our team. I used my content inventory I created for my MRP in Google Sheets as a template. The project as a whole felt a lot more doable after compiling the full inventory. I can no wappreciate that the simplicity of a scrollytelly is not only helpful for the reader, who can engage in passive scrolling to engage with the story, but also for the developers, who don’t need to develop a myriad of complex interactions! I also think that we did a good job as a group in brainstorming a way to tell a compelling story in an interesting way that DOESN’T require very complex interactions. Overall, it feels like our prototype is at a suitable level of complexity for our (complete lack of) technical proficiency, so it should be a good learning moment.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Looking at the content inventory made me a bit nervous though, as it put into focus what we need to do in the next three weeks… eek!
</div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Week 5: Feb 26 – March 4</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, we finalized the script as a team, I 3D modelled the bedroom asset, and I helped with the Webflow prototype.
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
As a team, we met remotely with Alex. Nic and I were both knocked flat on our feet from a cold, so Min thankfully took the lead on showing our progress and asking Alex for questions. The big takeaways from Alex were that (1) our script may not be currently suitable for our audience, or consistently match our visuals, and (2) we should skip the Figma prototype and go straight into Webflow to model interactions, and use our storyboard instead for style frames.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Moving forward from the meeting, Min and I went back and forth on multiple scripts, in a healthy push-and-pull of keeping the script accurate to the science while remaining empathetic and at a suitable reading level. On Sunday, all three of us met and talked through the last pain points (ex. whether or not to include a new player mineralocorticoid receptor to be more accurate) and make sure that both Min and I understood each other’s reasoning behind our edits. It was helpful to talk it out, and honestly if we hadn’t all been so sick it probably would have been easier in retrospect to have had a big sit-down to work through the script together at an earlier stage, rather than trading different script versions with each other. Lessons learned!
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Min had already drawn out a clean line drawing of the bedroom, which I used as a base to model a 3D room in Maya. The reasoning for this was to nail the perspective, make the style more rounded and approachable, and to make the changes between the different life stages (ex nursery room to kid’s bedroom) feel more distinct in contrast to the unchanging rest of the room. As I modelled the room, I also realized that it was a helpful reference in the lighting of the room, as I experimented with light sources from outside of the window, overhead light, and a lamp. Currently, the plan is still to use the 3D renders as a base for 2D renders of the bedroom. Is this the most effective use of time? To be honest, I’m not sure, since I spent almost 4 hours modelling (including getting feedback from the team). However, I did have a lot of fun with it, so no regrets there!
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Since Nic has been pretty sick, I talked with her and we all agreed that I would help her out with the prototype this week to keep us on track. I found some helpful Webflow tutorials online, and then took a crack at the prototype (stay tuned!).

            </div>

            <div class="text-space_subtitle">Week 6: March 5-11</div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
                This week, I focused on creating the 3D assets, and we finalized the script at last!
            </div>
            <div class="text-space_body">
First, I tweaked the room’s interior design after feedback from Min, and then I rendered it out again twice: one version with ambient lighting cues, and one transparent PNG linework version (using aiToon). They still need minor cleaning for some of the polygons, but hopefully this should save some time, and make our backgrounds consistent for when we transition between different time periods.
I passed off the Webflow prototype I created to Nic. I managed to get each interaction we needed working individually, but I had a lot of trouble getting them to work together, or get the scaling/framing adaptive. I set the dimensions to our planed 9:16 dimensions, but the prototype previews were not adapting to my window size, even when I went back to tweak things… hopefully Nic can figure it out.
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
Then, I focused on creating the 3D assets, so we can animate next week. For the molecules, I sourced MOL files from Molview, exported them to PDB files using ChimeraX, exported them to OBJ format with varying visualization types using VMD, and lastly brought them into Maya and cleaned them by merging their meshes and retopologizing where necessary. I created spheres, surface, and ball&stick visualizations to get feedback from the group – one possibility is that we could use a more complex version when we introduce the molecule, and then a more simplistic one as we show the pathway. We may even use symbols instead of the molecules themselves, but that is TBD…
Earlier in the week, I had a big surprise when Mark gave an in-depth tutorial for building and animating DNA strands in our 3D animation class. The second section of our prototype had a DNA animation, but we had decided not to include this section because it would be too much. Now that I had a recorded lecture that shows me exactly what I need to do, I decided I wanted to give it a try after all!
</div>
<div class="text-space_body">
At first, I wanted to try to use Molecular Maya (mMaya) to create a realistic DNA strand. However, after an hour of troubleshooting login credentials with no luck (even with help from Shay), I decided to go ahead and at least model cortisol and norepinephrine using our regular (although extended) MolViz pipeline. At first, I planned to try mMaya again in the morning, in case the login credentials needed time to register or something. However, after taking a closer look at Mark’s online tutorials (on his youtube channel 3Dsphlancnic), I realized that a simpler DNA strand would be more effective for animation. Plus, Mark carefully set up his DNA strand so the relative sizes and angles of rotation were accurate. After some thought, I decided this level of detail was sufficient for our level of audience, and more consistent with the style of the rest of our scrollytelly. I successfully modelled the DNA strand and it is ready to be animated. The only thing I’d like to troubleshoot is the backbone – right now it has a lot of hard corners, so I may ask Mark if there’s some way to bend them procedurally.
